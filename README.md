# Don't waste your time
I doubt anyone would use this in 2022. Thought it'd be cool to remake an old project of mine. Initially this was made for AJ Classic when the refer a friend feature released. Don't waste your time as I doubt it'll be useful, but feel free to try it as well.

# What it does
This generates your AJ Classic account ~1,500 gems per minute by abusing the refer a friend feature in the game.
