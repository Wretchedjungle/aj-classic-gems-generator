# Don't waste your time
I doubt anyone would use this, especially in 2022 when the game is virtually dying and it would be useless to 99% of people. Definitely feel free to try it or look at the source code if you wish.

# What it does
This simply creates accounts using your set referral code, giving you ~1500 gems per minute in the game.
